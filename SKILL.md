# Bootstrapping Assessment

Evaluate whether a business can be built without outside funding and design a constraint-driven launch strategy using Sara Blakely's methodology.

**Token Budget:** ~900 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Encourage putting essential living expenses at risk
- Advise skipping legally required protections (licensing, permits, insurance)
- Dismiss legitimate capital requirements for certain business types
- Recommend DIY approaches for tasks requiring professional certification

**If the business genuinely requires significant capital:** Be honest. Not all businesses can bootstrap. Sara Blakely's model works for certain business types.

---

## When to Use

- Someone asks "Do I need investors?" or "Should I raise funding?"
- Limited resources are presented as a barrier to starting
- Someone wants to evaluate bootstrap vs. funded path
- Designing a minimum viable launch with existing resources
- Someone says "I don't have enough money to start"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| business_idea | Yes | What they want to build |
| current_resources | Yes | Money, skills, time, connections available |
| revenue_model | No | How it will make money |
| timeline | No | When they want to launch |
| why_considering_funding | No | What they think they need money for |

## The Bootstrapping Framework

### Sara Blakely's Model

**The proof:** Started Spanx with $5,000. No investors. No loans. No business degree. No industry experience. Profitable from month one. Retained 100% ownership until 2021 ($1.2B valuation).

**The philosophy:** "A lot of people want to start big and think big and oftentimes get ahead of themselves."

### Assessment Dimensions

#### 1. The $5,000 Question
Could this business start with $5,000 or less?

**Sara's breakdown:**
- Patent: DIY research + $700 for attorney on claims
- Trademark: $150 on USPTO website
- Manufacturing: Negotiated minimum order with one mill
- Marketing: $0 (samples, PR, word of mouth)
- Operations: Nights and weekends while employed

**Question:** What if you HAD to start with only $5,000?

#### 2. Profitable-from-Day-One Test
Can this generate revenue before it needs more capital?

**Spanx reality:** First sale covered costs. Every dollar reinvested. No debt, no runway anxiety.

**Questions:**
- Can you charge for value immediately?
- What's the smallest version that someone would pay for?
- Can you presell before you build?

#### 3. DIY Inventory
What can you learn/do yourself instead of paying for?

**Sara's DIY list:**
- Patent application (bought book at Barnes & Noble)
- Legal structure research
- Prototype development
- Sales pitches
- PR and marketing

**Rule:** Learn it first, then decide if you need to outsource it.

#### 4. Constraints as Features
How do limitations become competitive advantages?

**Sara's constraint advantages:**
- No ad budget = samples strategy = better customer connection
- No industry experience = did things differently than everyone else
- No employees = stayed scrappy, moved fast

#### 5. Control vs. Speed Tradeoff
What do you lose with outside funding?

**Considerations:**
- Ownership percentage
- Decision-making autonomy
- Pressure to scale before ready
- Exit timeline pressure
- Reporting obligations

## Constraints

- Be honest about businesses that genuinely require capital (manufacturing at scale, regulated industries, capital-intensive models)
- Don't recommend putting personal financial security at risk
- Acknowledge that bootstrapping means slower growth
- Some tasks (legal, medical, financial advice) require professionals
- Bootstrap doesn't mean "no money" - it means self-funded, profitable early

### The $5,000 Challenge

If you HAD to launch with $5,000, here's how:

| Category | Traditional Cost | Bootstrap Alternative | Cost |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------|------|
| Office | $2,000/mo lease | Work from home / client sites | $0 |
| Website | $5,000 agency | DIY with Squarespace | $200/yr |
| Legal entity | $2,000 lawyer | LegalZoom LLC + template contracts | $500 |
| Marketing | $10,000 campaigns | LinkedIn content + referrals | $0 |
| Tools | $500/mo suite | Free tiers + essentials only | $100/mo |
| Runway | $30,000 savings | Keep job, do nights/weekends first | $0 |
| **Total** | $50,000+ | **Bootstrap Total** | $800 to start |

### Profitable-from-Day-One Path

**Smallest sellable version:** 10 hours of consulting per month at your current hourly rate equivalent
**Price point:** $150-300/hour depending on expertise
**First 10 customers:** Former colleagues, LinkedIn network, industry contacts who know your work
**Breakeven point:** 1 client paying for 20 hours/month covers most people's expenses

### DIY vs. Outsource

| Task | DIY Approach | When to Outsource |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Website | Squarespace template, write own copy | When you have 10+ clients and need scale |
| Contracts | Docracy templates + legal self-education | When contract value exceeds $50K |
| Accounting | Wave (free) + quarterly CPA review | When revenue exceeds $200K/year |
| Marketing | LinkedIn posts, referral asks, speaking | When you're turning away work |

### Constraints as Competitive Advantages

| Constraint | How It Becomes an Advantage |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| No employees | Lower overhead = can price competitively or keep more profit |
| Nights/weekends start | Proves demand before risking income |
| No office | Client-site presence = closer relationship |
| No marketing budget | Referral-based = higher quality clients |

### Bootstrap Timeline

| Phase | Actions | Budget | Revenue Target |
|-------|---------|--------|----------------|
| Month 1 | LLC setup, website, reach out to 20 contacts | $500 | Land 1 client |
| Month 2-3 | Deliver excellently, ask for referrals, content | $200 | 2-3 clients |
| Month 4-6 | Build pipeline until you can replace salary | $300 | 4-5 clients or equivalent hours |
| Month 7+ | Quit job when 3+ months pipeline secured | Reinvest | Grow from stable base |

### What You'd Lose with Funding

This business doesn't need funding. Taking money would mean:
- Giving up equity in a 100% margin business
- Pressure to hire before you need to
- Expectations to "scale" when consulting is inherently personal

### Sara's Reminder
"Don't be intimidated by what you don't know. That can be your greatest strength and ensure that you do things differently from everyone else."

You don't need $50,000. You need one client. The rest follows.

### Your First $5,000 Action
**This week:** Email 10 former colleagues or industry contacts. Not to pitch - to catch up. In the conversation, mention you're starting to do consulting. Ask if they know anyone who might need help with [your specialty]. You'll have your first lead within 2 weeks.
